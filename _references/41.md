"The term 'hypertext' (which gave birth to the term 'hyperlink') was originally coined by the pre-internet pioneer Ted Nelson in 1963. Nelson's vision for hypertext significantly differed from its eventual interpretation in that he proposed two-way links between information, rather than the now ubiquitous one-way web links later outlined by Tim Berners-Lee. Nelson saw Berners-Lee's work as a gross over-simplification of his original vision resulting in '*ever-breaking links, links going outward only, quotes you can't follow to their origins, no version management, no rights management*'." Ted Hunt on "The history of the hyperlink".
