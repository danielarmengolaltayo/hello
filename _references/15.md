"We live in an age where it's easier than ever to join a scenius. The Internet is basically a bunch of sceniuses connected together, divorced from physical geography. Blogs, social media sites, email groups, discussion boards, forumsâ€”they're all the same thing: virtual scenes where people go to hang out and talk about the things they care about." From the book "Show your work", by Austin Kleon.
