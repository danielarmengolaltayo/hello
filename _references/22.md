"In today's web, web pages have unidirectional links - so document A links to document B, but not vice versa. **Unidirectional links were a key factor in simplifying early web prototypes so that they could be feasibly implemented. However, this type of link limits the ability to trace back to related material**. Bidirectional links connect two documents using a two-way link that can be followed from either document. **Designs with bidirectional links, such as Ted Nelson's project Xanadu, were too complex to successfully construct**."
