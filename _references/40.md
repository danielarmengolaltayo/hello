"First we need to understand how we got here by challenging the methodologies and narratives that are augmenting the individualism of our modern society of the spectacle and feeding the toxicity of the digital economy with user-centered designs for selfish desires and other '*move fast and break things*' manifestations as the lean startups or hackathons." The Everything manifesto.
