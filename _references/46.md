"If they are bidirectional, a link always exists in the reverse direction. A disadvantage of this being enforced is that it might constrain the author of a hypertext - he might want to constrain the reader. However, an advantage is that often, when a link is made between two nodes, it is made in one direction in the mind of its author, but another reader may be more interested in the reverse link. Put another way, bidirectional linking allows the system to deduce the inverse relationship, that if A includes B, for example, that B is part of A. **This effectively adds information for free.** This is important when a critical parameter of the system is how long it takes someone to create a link." Under the question "Should the links be monodirectional or bidirectional?", Tim Berners-Lee reflects about a bidirectional behavior for links.
