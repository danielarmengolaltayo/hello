"Another interesting moment happened around 91ish or so when Tim Berners-Lee came out with the idea for HTML on the web and all this and what was striking about this is that the first time I saw it and anybody I knew saw they said, "wait a second, **this is weird because it doesn't have the backlinks, it's like one directional, you can link to something but it doesn't know it was linked to**". And everybody knew that **the whole point of hypermedia was the context**, because the context is where meaning comes from, without context it's just bits, right?".
