"There are data in every aspect of our lives, every aspect of work and pleasure, and it's not just about the number of places where data comes, it's about connecting it together. And **when you connect data together, you get power in a way that doesn't happen just with the web**." Tim Berners-Lee, "The next web" TED Talk 2009.
