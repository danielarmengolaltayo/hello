                        Two spaces of identical dimensions. One, inhabited by the artist, equipped with a controller and
                        a virtual reality headset. The second has a controller on the floor, waiting for someone to take
                        it. When visitors grab the controller and move it, they also move the controller that the artist
                        had in his hand, giving the illusion of being able to control the artist's movements, as if he
                        were a human puppet.

                        We live together in a beautiful but unbalanced world, where the fears and interests of some,
                        design the behaviors of many.
                        <br><br>
                        This relationship of power applies in any social interaction; we are constantly being influenced
                        by the thoughts and actions of the others, and vice versa, molding the persona, hence the entire
                        social fabric. Sometimes this happens naturally, free of intention, sometimes there is a hidden
                        agenda behind, and not always is easy to identify who controls whom.
                        <br><br>
                        Are you able to recognize the tools and strategies used to create, modify or determine behavior?
                        Do you act responsibly when using them on another human being?

                        In this graph you can see the activity recorded during the performance. The horizontal axis
                        represents the days. The vertical axis, the hours. Each line represents an
                        interaction and an interaction started to count when someone grabbed the
                        controller from the floor and stopped the moment they put it down again. 4840 interactions
                        counted, at an average of 1 minute per
                        interaction, spread over 40 days, during the two months of the exhibition.
