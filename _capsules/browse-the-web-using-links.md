All the pieces of information scattered across the Web are interconnected through links. From static web pages with links in the form of blue underlined words that change the cursor of your mouse to a tiny hand when you roll over them, into dynamic pages with links of all imaginable forms and flavors.

Both the content and the use we have made of the World Wide Web have changed very quickly, but the underlying design remains the same, more than 30 years after the official date of its invention.

On a macro scale, looking at human evolution, the Web and the technologies that provided the foundations for the Web to exist are in their infancy, or as Jaron Lanier likes to put it out, "we are toddlers" <sup>[1]</sup>. I coincide with Lanier's line of thought. There is plenty of room to grow and improve what we know as the Web, as we are starting to understand what becoming a digital society means and implies.
