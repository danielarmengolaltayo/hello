It is very common to use the terms of *the Internet* and *the Web* as synonyms without caring too much about the differences or the exact meaning. Depending on the context it's not a big deal, but because with this text I want you to pay attention particularly to one of them, the Web, I am going to go over the main differences really fast to be sure we are in the same page before we explore the topic further <sup>[1][2]</sup>.

- The Internet is infrastructure, more specifically, information infrastructure. The Web is a system running on top of this infrastructure <sup>[3][4]</sup>, like the email, for example.

- We use the Internet with the objective to improve communication between humans and we use the Web as a non-physical place where we actually meet to communicate and coordinate with others <sup>[5]</sup>. 

- The Internet links physical devices worldwide, **the Web connects pieces of information with other pieces of information**.
