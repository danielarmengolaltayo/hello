I am not the only one preoccupied with how links should behave <sup>[1]</sup>. The discussion began long before the birth of the Web <sup>[2]</sup> and it is difficult to imagine that it ends soon if we consider how many empires have been built on top of such behavior <sup>[3]</sup>.

Unidirectionality of links is one feature that deserves our attention if we want to improve our experience on the Web. One feature but not the only one. One strategy to challenge the statu quo, but not the only one. It is the one I have chosen to tackle first.

If we retrieve the relationship of mutual influence between technology and society described at the beginning of the text <sup>[4]</sup>, it seems that we are in front of a chicken-and-egg dilemma if we have to decide from which side to approach the situation. Both society <sup>[5]</sup> and tools <sup>[6]</sup> are valid perspectives from which to build a strategy, as well as many more. 

I am going to share my particular approach, perspective and progress in future texts, and I hope your participation will influence me along the way.

Thank you for joining me today :-)
