*This text is presented in a particular format. It is divided into small capsules to allow a different approach for both the writer <sup>[1]</sup> and the reader. You can get a complete overview of the content in less than a minute by just reading the outline. Footnotes and external links are complementary, not required to understand the content. Each capsule is written to work as a self-contained piece, which means you can read it independently although a sequential narrative is suggested. From there, explore as you please. Enjoy the reading.*
