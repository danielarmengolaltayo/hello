*This text is presented in a particular format. It is divided into small capsules to allow a different approach for both <a href="armengol-altayo.com"><span class="dotcontainer"><span class="dot nonselected"></span>the writer</span></a> and the reader. You can get a complete overview of the content in less than a minute by just reading <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/index.html">the outline</a>. Footnotes and external links are complementary, not required to understand the content. Each capsule is written to work as a self-contained piece, which means you can read it independently although a sequential narrative is suggested. From there, explore as you please. Enjoy the reading.*
