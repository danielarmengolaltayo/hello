                        This is an experiment specifically designed to test the limits of my state of
                        vigilance and concentration for a long period of time. My only task will be to focus my
                        attention on
                        capturing on paper one random instruction per second, automatically generated by a computer, in
                        a sort of guided meditation, stopping as few times as possible, for the shortest possible time.
                        <br><br>

                        We live in times dominated by a new medium that demands new forms of interaction and
                        communication. A medium that imposes such accelerated rhythms that it hardly leaves us room to
                        breathe, digest or reflect. It seems, that in this scenario, absurdity has become the maxim that
                        moves us, and that only
                        those who take it to the extreme, attracting the greatest number of looks and ears to their
                        discourses, will have the opportunity to influence the behavior of the social body.
                        <br><br>
                        This is my proposal of extreme absurdity: for 24 hours straight, I will subject my full
                        attention to the draining nature of the digital medium. Because, if attention is a limited
                        resource that can be exploited, where exactly is that limit?

                        Attention has become a valuable asset because it can be captured, measured, and profiled, and

                        These are the instructions to follow during the performance. The diagram shows the logic for the
                        same instructions, but visually.
                        <br><br>
                        STEP 1) Sit in front of the paper, the computer and the black and red markers. Focus your
                        attention on the first square delimited by the grid printed on the paper, and start the
                        computer's process: emit a "yes" or a "no", randomly, every second.
                        <br><br>
                        STEP 2) If the computer says "yes", paint the square you are focused on, using the black marker,
                        and move to the next square (left to right, top to bottom). If the computer says "no", just move
                        to the next square. Repeat until you reach the end of the paper.
                        <br><br>
                        CONDITION A) If you lose your attention, stop the computer's process, paint the next empty
                        square with the red marker, and when you are ready to continue, restart the computer's process,
                        and repeat step 2.
                        <br><br>
                        CONDITION B) When you reach the end of the paper, repeat from step 1, until you complete the 24
                        papers.
                        <br><br>
                        IMPORTANT) Keep all breaks as short as possible.
