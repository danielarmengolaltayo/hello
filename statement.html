                        Our existence depends on our ability to interact with the environment and transform reality. A
                        shared reality in which our actions influence what surrounds us, in the same way that the
                        environment influences our own behavior.
                        <br><br>
                        My artistic practice investigates this constant flow of influences in an effort to understand
                        and build my private reality, so that from there, new ideas are born, stories that soak the
                        material and infect the mind.
                        <br><br>
                        My medium is conceptual, and the form will be that which best encapsulates the intention of the
                        message.
                        <br><br>
                        I am here so that the transformation that emerges from me contributes to establishing new
                        patterns of behavior based on commitment, responsibility and respect for everything that exists.
