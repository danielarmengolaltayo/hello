                        Our existence depends on our ability to interact with the environment and transform reality.
                        <br><br>
                        We are constantly transforming reality with our actions, directly or indirectly influencing
                        everything surrounding us, while our environment, part of that same shared reality, influences
                        each and every one of our behaviors.
                        <br><br>
                        My practice investigates and intervenes in this constant flow of influences, in an effort to
                        make sense of my private reality.

                        The result is nothing more than the capture of an internal process, an opportunity to share and
                        participate in those stories dedicated to establishing new patterns of behavior, based on
                        commitment, responsibility, and respect for everything that exists.
